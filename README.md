The project involves designing and constructing a sun-tracking solar panel system utilizing an Arduino microcontroller. 
The primary goal is to enhance the efficiency of solar energy collection by automating the adjustment of the solar panel's angle to continuously face the sun. 
This tracking mechanism ensures that the panel is positioned optimally to capture maximum sunlight throughout the day.

A sun-tracking solar panel system has diverse applications ranging from enhancing residential and commercial solar power systems to supporting educational and research initiatives. 
By improving the efficiency of solar panels, it plays a crucial role in advancing the adoption and effectiveness of solar energy technologies.
